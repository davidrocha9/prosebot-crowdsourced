# prosebot-crowdsourced

The purpose of this repository is to study and analyse the human post-edits done to text generated by Prosebot, defined as Prosebot Crowdsourced.

Prosebot is a natural language generation system developed by ZOS, a Portuguese company which creates sports content for the online website zerozero.pt. This system generates textual football match summaries based on data stored on ZOS's databases. The goal of this study is to determine to which degree users of zerozero.pt make changes to generated text and, if the degree of similiarity is substantial, which kind of changes are made. This includes studying which kind of words are replaced and how sentences are reorganized.
